    This function changes the trench depth. The function starts at the end of a path and then
    and changes the trench depth in order that the maximum trench depth and minimum slope criteria
    are fulfilled. In case there are inflowing branches, the trench depth is not changed. In case
    the maximum trench depth is not fulfilled, a pump is added to the pump list.
